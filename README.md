# Gauge

This repo contains some sample scripts to use the Gauge API. For more information on Gauge please see https://www.canvaslms.com/gauge/

# Important Notes

All examples and contributions will have a `Working as of XX/XX/XXXX` date that will let you know when the last time it was ran and confirmed working. All pull requests with new scripts or modified scripts are required to have a `Working as of XX/XX/XXXX` date.


# Support
As always, all the files are provided AS-IS, without warranty, and without any support beyond this
document and anyone kind enough to help from the community.

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind. Instructure won't be
able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the community will hopefully help support
and keep both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
